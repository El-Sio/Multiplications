# Multiplications

**A simple HTML/CSS/JS app to learn multiplications tables (in french)**

Features 3 levels of difficulty :

- Easy : No time limit
- Intermediate : With a time limit (default 20s), modify it by chaing the 'TIME_LIMIT' variable in the script section.
- Expert : With half the time limit

Other Features :

- Visual and audio feedback for answers
- Mute button for all sounds (timer and answers)

Run Instructions :
- simple vanilla html/css/js so just run it locally or drop it on your favorite web server.

Next Steps (TODO) :

1. Add a "random" table with random questions across all tables.
2. Add "settings screen" to allow for time limit modification and other settings (color scheme etc.)
3. Record user results (session storage) and present personal best on each table per level
4. Achievement display with 3 star system (1 star for 10/10 score per level)
